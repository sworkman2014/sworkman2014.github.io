                We were brought in to refine and iterate on the existing product by adding in ads, upgrades, settings &amp; walkthroughs and eventually, to overhaul the whole thing to look great within iOS8 and implement a flat design style that would make the app feel iconic.
                <br><br>
                We're happy to say that it’s been the most downloaded business app in over 35 countries.

              <p class="slide-text">
                Working closely with Learndot’s developers, we designed a tight interface across the app which encompassed both the admin and user side.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                <br><br>
                The feedback loop was tight between design and internal development and we shared UI/UX sketches and new flows rapidly – sometimes live.

                We did a fast-paced, iterative design for this product. Going from concept to wireframes to finalized interface only took a few weeks.
                <br><br>
                After the prototypes and flow were all sorted out, we shipped the files to the iOS developers and made sure the details were all ironed out.&nbsp;

                The result: a sales system to interpret social information as relationship building touchpoints.
